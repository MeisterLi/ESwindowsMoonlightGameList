# ESwindowsMoonlightGameList
Automatic population of the EmulationStation roms folder with startable .cmd files to launch Moonlight as well as grabbing boxarts from Moonlight for ES on Windows

# Setup (on the client machine):

~~## Determine your Moonlight Server's UUID. 
In windows, you can find it in the registry at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Moonlight Game Streaming Project\Moonlight\hosts\\{hostnumber}
open the included file and change the "UUID" field to the UUID you just found.~~ 
No longer needed.  
However if you want to use a different host than the first in the Moonlight Host list, edit the updateGame.py and change the "1" in "host_number" to a different number corresponding to the host.

## Update some Configs if not using default Emulationstation installation
Edit the "emulationstation_location" if you don't use the regular EmulationStation install that uses %USERPROFILE%\\.emulationstation (i.E. you're using RetroBat)\
Edit the "moonlight_rom_location" if you use a different roms folder (i.E. you're using RetroBat)

## Create the folder "moonlight" in your emulationstation/roms/ directory

## Add "Moonlight" to your es_systems.cfg. 
See "es_systems.cfg" for an example

# Excecute the Script with Python 3

Enjoy!

Note: You may have to Scrape and/or start the game after it's entry has been made in order for the boxart to be fetched. Emulationstation does not seem to add games to the gamelist.xml otherwise.
